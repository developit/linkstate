# linkState

> Create an Event handler function that sets a given state property. Works with [preact] and [react].

-   **Tiny:** less than **300 bytes** of [ES3](https://unpkg.com/linkstate) gzipped
-   **Familiar:** it's just a function that does what you would have done manually
-   **Standalone:** one function, no dependencies, works everywhere

> 🤔 **Why?**
>
> linkState() is memoized: it only creates a handler once for each `(key, eventPath)` combination.
>
> This is important for performance, because it prevents handler thrashing and avoids allocations during render.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save linkstate
```

The [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/linkstate/dist/linkstate.umd.js):

```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/linkstate/dist/linkstate.umd.js"></script>
```

This exposes the `linkState()` function as a global.

## How It Works

It's important to understand what linkState does in order to use it comfortably.

**`linkState(component, statePath, [valuePath])`**

- `component`: the Component instance to call `setState()` on
- `statePath`: a key/path to update in state - can be dot-notated for deep keys
- `valuePath`: _optional_ key/path into the event object at which to retrieve the new state value

It's easiest to understand these arguments by looking at a simplified implementation of linkState itself:

```js
function linkState(component, statePath, valuePath, callback) {
  return event => {
    let update = {};
    update[statePath] = event[valuePath];
    component.setState(update, callback);
  };
}
```

In reality, accounting for dot-notated paths makes this trickier, but the result is the same.

Here's two equivalent event handlers, one created manually and one created with linkState:

```js
handleInput = e => {
  this.setState({ foo: e.target.value })
}

handleInput = linkState(this, 'foo')
```

Notice how we didn't specify the event path - if omitted, `linkState()` will use the `checked` or `value` property of the event target, based on its type.

## Usage

Standard usage is simply a function that returns an event handler to update state:

```js
import linkState from 'linkstate';

class Foo extends Component {
  state = {
    text: ''
  };
  render(props, state) {
    return (
      <input
        value={state.text}
        onInput={linkState(this, 'text')}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

You can also use it as a [**polyfill**](https://ponyfill.com/#polyfill). This emulates the behavior of Preact 7.x, which provided `linkState()` as a method on its `Component` class. Since you're then calling `linkState()` as a method of the component instance, you won't have to pass in `component` as an argument:

```js
import 'linkstate/polyfill';

// Component.prototype.linkState is now installed!

class Foo extends Component {
  state = {
    text: ''
  };
  render(props, state) {
    return (
      <input
        value={state.text}
        onInput={this.linkState('text')}
      />
    );
  }
}
```
